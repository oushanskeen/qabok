Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable.
### Independent
To be able to schedule and implement them in any order.
### Negotiable… and Negotiated
Not an explicit contract for features, rather, details will be co-created by the customer and programmer during development. A good story captures the essence, not the details.

### Valuable
to the customer.

### Estimable
just enough to help the customer rank and schedule the story’s implementation. Bigger stories are harder to estimate.

### Small
Smaller stories tend to get more accurate estimates.

### Testable
“I understand what I want well enough that I _could_ write a test for it.”
